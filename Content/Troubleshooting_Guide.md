# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides solutions for common issues you may encounter while using the API or related tools. Follow the troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue or identify potential causes.

## 1. Authentication Errors

### 1.1 Error: `401 Unauthorized`

**Cause:**  
This error occurs when the authentication token is invalid or missing.

**Solution:**  
- Ensure you are using a valid token.
- Verify that the token has the necessary permissions for the requested resources.
- Check if the token is still active and not expired.

### 1.2 Error: `403 Forbidden`

**Cause:**  
This error may occur when you exceed rate limits or do not have sufficient permissions.

**Solution:**  
- Check the rate limit status by reviewing the `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers.
- If rate limits are exceeded, wait until the limit resets.
- Ensure you have the appropriate permissions for the operation you are trying to perform.

## 2. Repository Not Found

### 2.1 Error: `404 Not Found`

**Cause:**  
The repository or file path may be incorrect.

**Solution:**  
- Double-check the repository `owner`, `repo`, and `path` parameters.
- Ensure the repository exists and the path you are accessing is valid.
- If the repository is private, make sure you have access permissions.

## 3. Rate Limiting

### 3.1 Error: Rate Limit Exceeded

**Cause:**  
Rate limits are imposed on API requests. If exceeded, you may receive errors until the rate limit is reset.

**Solution:**  
- Monitor the `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers to check how many requests you can still make.
- Consider using OAuth authentication to increase your rate limit (up to 5,000 requests per hour).
- Wait for the rate limit reset (`X-RateLimit-Reset`) to occur.

## 4. Data Formatting Issues

### 4.1 Error: Incorrect Data Format

**Cause:**  
The API response may be in an unexpected format, such as missing required fields or incorrect encoding.

**Solution:**  
- Ensure that the `Accept` header is set to `application/vnd.github+json` for correct JSON responses.
- If the content is base64-encoded, decode it appropriately based on the `encoding` field in the response.

## 5. Connection Timeouts

### 5.1 Error: Request Timeout

**Cause:**  
This error can occur if the server takes too long to respond or if there are network issues.

**Solution:**  
- Check your network connection to ensure it is stable.
- Try increasing the timeout setting for the request.
- If using a proxy, verify the proxy configuration.

## 6. File Retrieval Issues

### 6.1 Error: `File Not Found`

**Cause:**  
The specified file path may be incorrect or the file might not exist in the repository.

**Solution:**  
- Double-check the `path` parameter to ensure it points to the correct file.
- Ensure the file exists in the specified repository and branch/tag.

## 7. General Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Review Documentation:**  
   Always refer to the [GitHub REST API Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) and [Postman Documentation](https://www.postman.com/docs) for the latest updates and detailed information.

2. **Check API Status:**  
   Visit [GitHub Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/) to check if there are any ongoing incidents or outages affecting the API.

3. **Verify Request Formatting:**  
   Ensure your requests are formatted correctly, including the proper headers, parameters, and endpoint URLs.

4. **Use Debugging Tools:**  
   Use tools like Postman or cURL to test API requests. These tools provide detailed logs of the request/response cycle.

5. **Reach Out for Support:**  
   If you're still facing issues after following the troubleshooting steps, reach out to the API support team or community forums for assistance.
